          <h1>Hello World!</h1>
          <p>
            Now this is a story all about how<br />
            My life got flipped-turned upside down<br />
            And I'd like to take a minute<br />
            Just sit right there<br />
            I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air<br />
            <br />
            In west Philadelphia born and raised<br />
            On the playground was where I spent most of my days<br />
            Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool<br />
            And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school<br />
            When a couple of guys who were up to no good<br />
            Started making trouble in my neighborhood<br />
            I got in one little fight and my mom got scared<br />
            She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air."<br />
            <br />
            I begged and pleaded with her day after day<br />
            But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way<br />
            She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.<br />
            I put my Walkman on and said, "I might as well kick it."<br />
            <br />
            First class, yo, this is bad<br />
            Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass.<br />
            Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?<br />
            Hmm, this might be alright.<br />
            <br />
            But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that<br />
            Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?<br />
            I don't think so<br />
            I'll see when I get there<br />
            I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air<br />
            <br />
            Well, the plane landed and when I came out<br />
            There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out<br />
            I ain't trying to get arrested yet<br />
            I just got here<br />
            I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared<br />
            <br />
            I whistled for a cab and when it came near<br />
            The license plate said "Fresh" and it had dice in the mirror<br />
            If anything I could say that this cab was rare<br />
            But I thought, "Nah, forget it."<br />
            – "Yo, home to Bel-Air."<br />
            <br />
            I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8<br />
            And I yelled to the cabbie, "Yo home smell ya later."<br />
            I looked at my kingdom<br />
            I was finally there<br />
            To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air<br />
